# Chart-Generator-only-HTML_CSS-
This is my first chart project using HTML_CSS only
While creating charts with only HTML and CSS has limitations, it's a fantastic starting point for your journey into chart generation. This approach allows you to experiment with fundamental concepts like using HTML elements to represent chart structures and CSS for styling those elements. You can build basic bar charts by defining bars with elements like <div> or <span> and styling them with properties like width, height, background color, and positioning. For a touch of creativity, consider using CSS pseudo-elements and animations to enhance the visual appeal.
